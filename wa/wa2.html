        Hello! My name is <strong>Eric Hoang</strong> (he/him). 
        My goal for this course is to learn 
        how to create an aesthetic and functional 
        portfolio for myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm a second year student majoring in CTD. 
        I'm involved in Asian Unity and Vietnamese
        Student Association at CU. Outside of school,
        I like to lift weights, go fishing, go hiking, 
        and try out new food.
