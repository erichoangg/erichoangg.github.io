        <p>Peyton Williams Manning (born March 24, 1976) is an American former football quarterback who played in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League" target="_blank">National Football League</a> (NFL) for 18 seasons. Nicknamed "the Sheriff",[1] he spent 14 seasons with the Indianapolis Colts and four with the Denver Broncos.[2] Manning is considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[3][4][5][6][7][8] A member of the Manning football dynasty, he is the second son of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and an older brother of former NFL quarterback Eli Manning. He played college football at Tennessee, where he won the Maxwell, Davey O'Brien, and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Awards as a senior en route to victory in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_SEC_Championship_Game" target="_blank">1997 SEC Championship</a>.</p>

        <p>Manning was selected first overall in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_NFL_Draft" target="_blank">1998 NFL Draft</a> by the Colts, where he served as their starting quarterback from 1998 to 2010. He helped transform the struggling Colts franchise into consistent playoff contenders, leading them to 11 playoff appearances, eight division titles, three AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl appearances, and one championship title in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XLI" target="_blank">Super Bowl XLI</a>, the franchise's first in over three decades and first since relocating to Indianapolis.[9][10][11][12][13] Manning was also named Super Bowl MVP in the victory. After undergoing neck surgery that sidelined him for the 2011 season, Manning was released by the Colts and signed with the Broncos. Serving as the Broncos' starting quarterback from 2012 to 2015, he helped them clinch their division each season and reach two Super Bowls. Manning's career ended with a victory in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_50" target="_blank">Super Bowl 50</a>, making him the first starting quarterback to win the Super Bowl for more than one franchise.[14]</p>

            <p>Manning was selected by the Indianapolis Colts as the first overall pick in the 1998 NFL Draft.[86] He became the second player in Tennessee's school history to be drafted #1 overall, the first since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cafego" target="_blank">George Cafego</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_NFL_Draft" target="_blank">1940 NFL Draft</a>.[87] He started as a rookie and went on to play for the Colts for 13 full seasons before being sidelined by a neck injury, which cost him the entire 2011 season.[88] After recovering from the injury, he was released by the Colts and joined the Denver Broncos for whom he played from the 2012 season[89] to the 2015 season. Excluding the year lost to the neck injury, Manning played in 17 NFL seasons.[90]</p>

            <p>Manning is considered to be one of the greatest NFL quarterbacks of all time.[91][92] He was named the NFL's most valuable player a record five times (four times with the Colts, once with the Broncos), was named to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl" target="_blank">Pro Bowl</a> 14 times, and named a first-team All-Pro seven times. As a starter up until the end of the 2015 season, he had a career winning percentage of .702 in the regular season. He held the NFL record for career touchdown passes from 2014 to 2019 and the career passing yards record from 2015 to 2018. Manning is also the only quarterback in NFL history to appear in four Super Bowls with a different head coach each time, playing under Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox, and Gary Kubiak when he reached the league's championship.[93]</p><br>
